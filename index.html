                    I have 7-year front desk experience in Is Investment.
                    Throughout my career, I worked as a part of the derivative team of the company, where our mandate was
                    market making in option and warrant markets in Borsa Istanbul. Anyone in the sector knows that the famous
                    Black-Scholes model is the core formula for pricing/hedging of options, which is why I put a
                    calculator to show a little piece of my portfolio. Those who are unfamiliar with the model could watch 
                    the video first before tinkering the calculator.
                    I would love to share ideas, improve collaboration and make fancy things together.
                    For those of you are interested in collaboration, please visit contact page to reach out to me.
